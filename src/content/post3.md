I am a Monster inside of me

Whose rules are not set to be

I am the very side of me

The society had not see

<br>

The Monster bite by the night

The Monster q'eit by the light

The Monster powered by your light

The Monster crumbl'd by the knight

<br>

O! The Knight inside of me

Every-day fighting with the

Most uncivilised part of me

The Monster wanting thee

<br>

They fight both night and light

Giving me the harshest blight

Two thinking that I'm blind

But never heard that I whined

<br>

Who wins inside me this fight

I really hope not the Knight

I want the Monster alive by the light

I want the Knight dead by the night

<br>

The Monster wanting thee

The Monster craving thee

The Knight keeping the 

Monster away from thee

<br>

I am the Monster inside of me

My rules are not set to be

I am the Monster craving thee

I am the killer of the Knight of me

<br>

I, the Monster, killed the Knight

I, the Knight, killed by the Night

I, the Monster, freed by the light

I, the Monster, powered by your light
