Golden silk laid on red roses,

A face of metal with which she poses.

Tales and such are her profession,

Lies are the sweetest in her posession.

White cloth with two dark pearls,

And a silver tounge with which she (hurts).

All day long she prowls and hunts,

It buys her food so her best she tries.

No different i was, just a prey,

But fell for her i did, she took my mind away.
